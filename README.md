Interpreting user needs and implementing them:
Intepreting user needs involves understanding the problems or challenges the users face and knowing what they hope to achieve. This requires active listening and a user centered mindset. 
The role of user stories:
The role of user stories are crucial to understanding the user. They provide a simple want and end goal of a software feature. Writing user stories encourages the coder to think about the end user and helps understand them from a non technical side.

Approach to developing programs and agile processes:
My approach to developing programs is mostly incremental. Starting at the basis of an idea and expanding on it as time goes on allows it to evolve through cycles and feedback. This helps also with going of track.
Incorporating agile:
When developing, I would use SCRUM. I am best educated on it after this class and it does seem to be the most efficient process for a team. Often having meetings and feedback is crucial and very helpful.

Being a good team member
Being a good team member in software does not only apply to technical skill. Though important, it is very important to know how to work and communicate with others. Collaboration is key to success, especially in a business environment. The best and most useful software is rarely anymore developed by a single person as the scale has expanded. A good team member listens and actively applies feedback and tries to better themselves. They also do not keep information to themselves and are reliable, just like any other team oriented job. Collective ownership is key.
